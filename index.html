                <p><b>Game Background:</b> Mental health is
                essential to a person’s well-being, healthy family and interpersonal
                relationships, and the ability to live a full and productive life. People,
                including children and adolescents, with untreated mental health disorders
                are at high risk for many unhealthy and unsafe behaviors, including
                self-destructive behavior, and suicide. According to the World Health
                Organization (WHO), one in four people will experience a mental or
                neurological disorder at some point in their lives (WHO, 2001).  This
                means that everyone in the world is potentially one trauma away from
                experiencing a mental health disorder.
                The Coronavirus or COVID-19 has been devastating to countries around the world
                by causing illness, deaths, economic hardships, and social isolation. Two
                students from Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health and three students
                from Georgia Institute of Technology have come together to create the
                Student Advocates of Mental Illness (SAMI).  The SAMI organizers have
                created a Facebook game named “Mental Wealth Quiz” to allow adult gamers
                ages 18 years or older to assess their mental health needs and provide them
                with a list of mental wellness games and resources to assist them on their
                mental health journey.

                <p><b>Terms
                and Conditions:</b>  This quiz was created by the Student Advocates of Mental
                Illness (SAMI) team as part of the EGHI/GT HACK COVID-19 competition.
                The purpose of this “Hackathon” was to provide a public health solution
                to a COVID-19 related public health issue.  Thus the purpose of this game
                is to provide a solution to the access of mental health resources not only
                during a time of massive illnesses, deaths, economic hardship, and social
                isolation but for the foreseeable future as well.
                This Facebook game uses select questions from an American Psychiatric Association
                (APA) assessment tool known as the DSM-5.  This quiz does not provide a
                complete assessment of your mental health and is not being reviewed by mental
                health professionals.  The game was created solely on the review of research
                journals and news articles and will be used for public health research purposes.
                The information provided via the quiz is for entertainment purposes only and
                should be viewed as such.  If you feel you have a mental health disorder or
                would like to know more about your mental health, please contact your health
                provider for additional resources.<br> <b>If you feel you are in a mental health
                crisis and need immediate assistance, please call 911.</b>
                <br><br> Changes can be made to this quiz at any time and without notice.
                All information provided could be placed in a database and sent to state
                or federal officials in support for the creation of mental health resources
                and facilities within the state you provided in the Facebook game.</p>
