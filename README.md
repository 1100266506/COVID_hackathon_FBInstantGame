### Purpose
The application was built in an effort to rapidly and easily deliver a test to diagnosis growing mental health problems from the COVID-19 epidemic. The quiz uses mental health questions from the American Psyciatric Association to diagnose problems such as suicide, depression, mania, etc. This is in no way a replacement for professional medical help, however is meant to link users to resources and make them more aware of mental health problems they may be facing.
